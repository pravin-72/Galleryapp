## How I Built This

In developing GalleryPic, I focused on creating a clean and efficient user interface using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. The gallery's responsiveness was a priority to ensure seamless access on all devices.

## Future Enhancements

As GalleryPic marks my initial venture into web development, there are potential improvements to be considered:

- **Photo Management:** Implement a back-end system for users to upload, store, and manage their photo collections.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Add functionality to filter and sort photos based on tags, date, or other criteria.
- **User Accounts:** Incorporate user authentication to allow personalized galleries for registered users.
